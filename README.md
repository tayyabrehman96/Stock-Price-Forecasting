### README: Stock Price Forecasting using ARIMA

This project focuses on time-series forecasting to predict stock prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. It provides insights into past trends and predicts future values, demonstrating advanced forecasting skills relevant to the financial domain.

### How to Use

1. Install Required Packages:
   bash
   pip install yfinance statsmodels matplotlib numpy pandas
   

2. Run the Code:
   - Replace 'AAPL' with any stock symbol you wish to forecast.
   - Adjust ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) to improve performance if needed.

3. Interpreting Results:
   - Accuracy is measured using MSE.
   - Visualizations help compare forecasted vs actual prices and predict future trends.


This project highlights proficiency in financial forecasting using ARIMA models and provides a practical example of predicting stock market trends.
